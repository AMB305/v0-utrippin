    content: `
      <p>Car rentals can eat up a significant portion of your travel budget, but with these insider hacks, you can save hundreds of dollars on your next rental. Here are the strategies that travel experts use.</p>

      <h2>Hack #1: The "Priceline Express" Strategy</h2>
      <p>One of the most effective ways to save on car rentals is using Priceline's "Express Deals" or similar opaque booking platforms:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>You won't know the exact company until after booking</li>
        <li>Savings can range from 20-60% off regular rates</li>
        <li>Best for travelers with flexible pickup locations</li>
        <li>Always works best for standard car categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hack #2: The Airport vs Off-Airport Trick</h2>
      <p>Conventional wisdom says airport rentals are more expensive, but this isn't always true:</p>
      
      <h3>When Airport is Better:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>During peak season in tourist destinations</li>
        <li>When off-airport lots charge shuttle fees</li>
        <li>For short-term rentals (1-2 days)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When Off-Airport Wins:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Extended rentals (week or longer)</li>
        <li>During business travel periods</li>
        <li>In cities with expensive airport fees</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hack #3: The Costco/Warehouse Club Secret</h2>
      <p>Warehouse clubs offer some of the best car rental deals available:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Costco Travel:</strong> Often beats other discounts by 10-25%</li>
        <li><strong>BJ's Travel:</strong> Includes second driver free on many bookings</li>
        <li><strong>Sam's Club:</strong> Offers additional member-only promotions</li>
        <li>Most include extras like additional drivers and GPS at no charge</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hack #4: The Credit Card Game</h2>
      <p>The right credit card can save you more than just money:</p>
      
      <h3>Primary Insurance Coverage:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chase Sapphire Preferred/Reserve</li>
        <li>Capital One Venture cards</li>
        <li>American Express premium cards</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Elite Status Benefits:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic upgrades when available</li>
        <li>Skip-the-line privileges</li>
        <li>Bonus points on rentals</li>
        <li>Free additional drivers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hack #5: The "Modification" Loophole</h2>
      <p>This advanced strategy can save you significant money:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Book a refundable reservation when prices are low</li>
        <li>Continue monitoring prices after booking</li>
        <li>If prices drop, book a new reservation</li>
        <li>Cancel the original booking (if refundable)</li>
        <li>Some platforms allow unlimited free modifications</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Hidden Fees to Avoid</h2>
      
      <h3>Common Fee Traps:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Young Driver Fees:</strong> Can add $25-50/day for drivers under 25</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Driver Fees:</strong> $10-15/day per extra driver</li>
